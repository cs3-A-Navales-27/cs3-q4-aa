        <div id="whatIsDescription">
            Population genetics studies have significantly improved our understanding of fungal pathogen evolutionary biology, revealing crucial features such as distribution range, reproductive system, and transmission pathways. This approach has helped in identifying that many pathogens are subdivided into small geographical areas and that only a few are ancient strictly asexual species. The upcoming genomic data will help develop population genetic models tailored to fungal pathogens, such as complex life cycles or nonpanmictic mating systems. There is still much to discover using population genetics. Most existing work has been focused on fungal species causing disease of humans, agricultural crops, or domesticated animals in the developed world. Studies are needed of pathogens from wild species in natural settings, from developing areas, and of nonpathogenic species that might be the pathogens of the future.
